# Latex-Assignment-template
Here are the Latex templates designed by myself for collage assignment.

## Template 1
This is a very simple template which just has a headline.

## Template 2 (UVic theme)
This is a template for UVic I frequently using. It is a more offical template which has a cover page with university logo, department and course name. For the question and answer, I define an "answer" environment that begins with "Answer" and different font family.

## More on the way
I have some other Latex templates for lab report and thesis. But still under construction and improving. I will update in the future.
