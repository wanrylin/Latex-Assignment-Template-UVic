# Latex-Assignment-template
Here are the Latex templates designed by myself for collage assignment.

## Template 1
This is a very simple template which just has a headline.

## Template 2 (UVic theme)
This is a template for UVic I frequently using. It is a more offical template which has a cover page with university logo, department and course name. For the question and answer, I define an "answer" environment that begins with "Answer" and different font family.
### Attention
To use this template, you need to finish the followings:
1. Change the logo to your university and change the address of the logo file.
2. Install mcode package which is developed to support showing MATLAB code in latex file same as in MATLAB. You can download from: https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8015-m-code-latex-package<br>
and find some instruction here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te

## More on the way
I have some other Latex templates for lab report and thesis. But still under construction and improving. I will update in the future.
