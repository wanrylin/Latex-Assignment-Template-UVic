# Latex-Assignment-template
Here are the Latex templates designed by myself for collage assignment.

## Template 1
This is a very simple template which just has a headline.

## Template 2 (UVic theme)
This is a template for UVic I frequently using. It is a more offical template which has a cover page with university logo, department and course name. For the question and answer, I define an "answer" environment that begins with "Answer" and different font family.
